Welcome to my website :) I recently graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering with a focus on Embedded Systems development.

Having grown up in the SF Bay Area, I have a home-grown affinity towards the latest and greatest computer hardware. However, I am most interested in how this technology can be used to simplify people's lives instead of complicating them. Creating a truly 'embedded' system that mates the infinite potential of the digital and internet-connected computer with an intuitive human-oriented interface and workflow is my goal for any project I am passionate about. I believe that thoughtful design and intentional simplicity can let any product impart positivity to the person using it.

Outside of my academic and work life, I enjoy reading books of all genres, trying out new recipes, and working on a project/skill that interests me. While I am doing that, I'm always checking out new genres of music or watching whatever TV drama I am obsessed with. I am definitely a homebody but I am always looking for new experiences and restaurants to try out with my friends!

This website serves to highlight my experiences and accomplishments. Look through my projects page (in-progress) or scroll through my CV.
